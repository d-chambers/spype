Contributing
============

Contributions to spype are welcome. 

If you find a problem, would like to propose a change, or have a question, use the `issue tracker <https://github.com/d-chambers/spype/issues>`_.

I will be making some rather rapid changes until version 0.1.0, after which I more or less plan to follow the `obspy branching model <https://github.com/obspy/obspy/wiki/ObsPy-Git-Branching-Model>`_. Basically, if you want to fix a bug use branch "maintenance_version" where version is the last released version. If you want to add a new feature just branch off master.
